    "description1": "Musical transposition is the process of shifting a collection of notes (such as a melody, harmony, or scale) up or down in pitch by a constant interval. This means that every note in the music is adjusted by the same proportional change in pitch, resulting in a new key. Transposition is commonly used to accommodate different vocal ranges, instrument tunings, or to make a piece easier to read and perform.",
    "description2": "This website is a tool designed for quick and easy transposition. It offers a simple interface to transpose a single note from one key to another, as well as a more advanced interface to transpose an entire scale. This feature allows musicians to easily play a piece in the same key when using two instruments with different tunings, for example.",
    "nameHeading": "About the name <0>ClaveShift</0>:",
    "nameIntro": "The name <0>ClaveShift</0> combines two terms: <1>clave</1> and <2>shift</2>.",
    "claveMeaning": "<0>Clave</0>: In Spanish, \"clave\" means \"key\", which directly relates to musical keys and transposition. In music theory, changing keys is a core concept, so \"Clave\" captures the tool's focus on key changes.",
    "shiftMeaning": "<0>Shift</0>: \"Shift\" conveys the action of moving from one key to another, which is exactly what this tool doesâ€”it shifts notes and scales between keys to make transposition easier for musicians.",
