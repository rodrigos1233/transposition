    "description": "ClaveShift.com, formerly MusicTranspositor.com, is an online transposer tool that allows you to easily transpose a single note from one key to another.",

    "mainHeading": "About Musical Transposition:",
    "description1": "Musical transposition is the process of shifting a collection of notes (such as a melody, harmony, or scale) up or down in pitch by a constant interval. This means that every note in the music is adjusted by the same proportional change in pitch, resulting in a new key. Transposition is commonly used to accommodate different vocal ranges, instrument tunings, or to make a piece easier to read and perform.",
    "description2": "This website is a tool designed for quick and easy transposition. It offers a simple interface to transpose a single note from one key to another, as well as a more advanced interface to transpose an entire scale. This feature allows musicians to easily play a piece in the same key when using two instruments with different tunings, for example.",
    "nameHeading": "About the name <0>ClaveShift</0>:",
    "nameIntro": "The name <0>ClaveShift</0> combines two terms: <1>clave</1> and <2>shift</2>.",
    "claveMeaning": "<0>Clave</0>: In Spanish, \"clave\" means \"key\", which directly relates to musical keys and transposition. In music theory, changing keys is a core concept, so \"Clave\" captures the tool's focus on key changes.",
    "shiftMeaning": "<0>Shift</0>: \"Shift\" conveys the action of moving from one key to another, which is exactly what this tool does—it shifts notes and scales between keys to make transposition easier for musicians.",

    "circleOfFifthsTitle": "Circle of Fifths",
    "circleOfFifthsDescription": "The circle of fifths arranges all 12 musical keys so that each adjacent pair is separated by a perfect fifth (7 semitones). Clockwise movement adds sharps; counter-clockwise adds flats. Adjacent keys share all but one note, making them closely related harmonically.",
    "circleOfFifthsExplanation": "The blue hand points to the origin key and the red hand points to the target key. A small angle means the keys are harmonically close and share most of their notes \u2014 transpositions will involve minimal changes. A large angle (up to 180\u00b0, the tritone) means the keys are more distant, requiring more accidental changes. Note that this harmonic proximity is not the same as chromatic proximity: keys a semitone apart (a minor second) sit on nearly opposite sides of the circle, while keys a fifth apart are neighbours. The outer ring shows key signatures, the inner ring shows scale names in the selected mode. Use the button below the circle to cycle through modes.",
    "noteSelectDescription": "Choose the note you want to transpose. Use the toggle above to switch between transposing across instrument keys or by a musical interval.",
    "scaleSelectDescription": "Choose the root note and mode of the scale. Modes like Major and Minor define the pattern of whole and half steps that gives the scale its character.",
    "originInstrumentDescription": "Transposing instruments sound a different pitch than written — for example, a B\u266d clarinet sounds B\u266d when the player reads C. Select the instrument or key your music is written for.",
    "targetInstrumentDescription": "Select the instrument or key you want to transpose to. The tool will calculate the correct written notes so both instruments produce the same sounding pitches.",
    "intervalSelectDescription": "An interval measures the distance between two notes in semitones (half steps). Choose the direction and size of the interval to transpose by.",
